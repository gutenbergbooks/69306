<h3>
THE TIMES OF THE BROTHERS VAN EYCK
</h3>

<p>
The unusual activity which during the latter
half of the fourteenth and the first half of
the fifteenth centuries throbbed throughout the
whole of the Netherlands forms one of the most
interesting and surprising studies of national
progress that history has furnished.
</p>

<p>
Geographically and politically, in her arts
and in her industries, the country was affected
by changes both radical and lasting.  Some
years before the period which embraces the
life of the subjects of this biographical sketch,
the German Ocean had invaded the northern
territory of the Netherlands, and had
disorganised a Parliament and divided a people.
At the beginning of the thirteenth century over
the whole of that low-lying and marshy tract
between Kampen on the east and Amsterdam
to westward, and southward to within sight of
Nieukerk, the North Sea swept in upon the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
inland lake of Flevo, swallowing thousands of
hamlets, villages, and towns suddenly and
completely.  Until this time there had been but
one Friesland, including Holland, divided only
by the Vlie, a small stream hardly to be
counted a river.  Now East Friesland and
West Friesland were divided by this vast
stretch of water, the stormy and dangerous
Zuyderzee, and it became impossible for
Holland to send her representatives to the
general assemblies at Aurich.  West Friesland
was absorbed by Holland, and East Friesland
became a self-governing State, and remained
such until the power of Charles V. was
established.  Thus politically as well as
geographically was the country disrupted by the
forces of Nature.
</p>

<p>
To trace the rise of the Netherlands as a
European Power from a more remote period
than the beginning of the fourteenth century
would be beyond the range of this sketch; but
for the purpose of showing the general advance
of the country's interests a brief summary of
the events culminating in the wellnigh despotic
power of the House of Burgundy may refresh
the reader's mind, as they affect the constitution
of the nation, and may serve to point cause
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
and effect in the increasing prosperity of the
country and in the resulting advance of art;
for just as the political influence of the
Burgundian Princes spread from their hereditary
provinces first over Flanders and Brabant&mdash;over
that part of the Netherlands which is now
known as Belgium&mdash;and finally over the Dutch
provinces, so the current of art swept from
Burgundy to Flanders and thence to Holland.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the fourteenth century
Holland was ruled by the House of Avennes,
Counts of Hainault.  Holland having previous
to the accession of the Avennes annexed
Zeeland, the three provinces may almost be
regarded as the nucleus of the Dutch power.
William IV., last of the Hainault line, died
childless in 1355.  His death was the signal
for the outbreak of a long and spasmodic series
of civil disturbances between the nobles and
the cities and municipalities.  These parties,
known by the titles of the Hooks and the
Kabblejaus (codfish), continued their intermittent
strife throughout the succeeding 150 years.
In the meantime William IV. was succeeded
by William of Bavaria.  Then followed his
brother Albert, who was in turn succeeded by
his son William VI.  At the death of the latter
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
the reins of government were left in the
uncertain hands of his young daughter, Jacqueline,
a girl of seventeen.  Jacqueline, it appears, led
anything but a happy life.  Her cousin, Philip
the Good, Duke of Burgundy, for thirteen
years plundered and robbed her, and at her
death in 1437 he had already dispossessed her
of her lands and reduced her from the position
of Sovereign to that of Lady Forester in her
own provinces, whilst for himself he had laid the
foundation of that Greater Netherlands which
by conquest and annexation he proceeded to
extend.
</p>

<p>
Having acquired the principal Netherlands
and inherited the two Burgundies and the
counties of Flanders and Artois, he had
purchased the county of Namur, usurped the
duchy of Brabant, and annexed the barony of
Mechlin.  A few years later he acquired also
the duchy of Luxembourg.
</p>

<p>
Philip was now the ruler of what may be
termed a kingdom of several peoples, who,
though in a measure distinct, were of similar
temperament and character, and who may be
counted now as one.  Never has conqueror
been in a happier position when faced with the
problem of welding together his conquests.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
For Philip ruled those whose interests were
similar, and whose characteristics were almost
identical&mdash;a people born of the sea, strong and
fearless, who had lived by strife with their
fellows and by strife with Nature; a people
born to toil and to hardship, whose battle for
life had been with Nature herself&mdash;a race which
for centuries had fought with swamp and water
year in, year out, conquering a mile of morass
or patch of barren furze, striving for the soil to
live upon, working not for gold, but for life.
This nation had now become a power of
natural strength and of dominating physique,
virile and live and expansive, whose sons, with
brooms at their mastheads, should later sweep
the seas from whose destructive embrace she
had succeeded in wresting herself.
</p>

<p>
Under the rule of the Burgundian the
prosperity of the Netherlands rapidly increased.
In Holland and in Flanders, in Brabant and
in the other leading provinces, industry and
wealth, agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,
were ever augmenting.  While Philip, in
the zenith of his power, flushed with the
passion and success of territorial acquisition,
busied himself with the glorification of his
sovereignty by founding at Bruges, amid a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
scene of indescribable splendour, the Order of
the Golden Fleece, "to the honour of God, of
the Blessed Virgin, and of the holy Andrew,"
a principle more potent than even territorial
power was evolving.  For in Haarlem an
undistinguished sexton wrestled with the
intricacies of the printing-press.  Lorenz Coster
was printing his book of the Dutch language.
The question as to the time and place of the
invention of printing will probably never be
settled to the satisfaction of Holland and
Germany; but the men of Haarlem still claim
upon very sound and substantial evidence that
between 1423 and 1440 their citizen was the first
to employ movable type, which is generally
considered the invention of printing proper, as
distinguished from the more ancient block-printing.
</p>

<p>
Whatever objection may be legitimately
raised to the application of the title "The
Good" to a ruler of Philip's character, this
Burgundian had many of the qualities that go
to the making of a successful monarch.  His
military talents were considerable; his political
methods, though despotic, were practicable.
Though he taxed the wealth of his country, he
protected and encouraged the commerce and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
manufactures of Holland and Flanders, their
arts and crafts, science and literature.  He
founded at Bruges the famous Burgundian
Library.  He remodelled, and to some extent
endowed, the University of Louvain.  His
munificence and princely generosity attracted
to his Court at Bruges men of letters like
Oliver de la Marche and Philippe de Commines,
and famous painters like Jan van Eyck,
and perhaps, though we lack documentary
evidence, his elder brother Hubert, who gave,
perhaps, more to the art of painting than even
did Coster to the art of printing, or Philip
himself to the sciences of statesmanship and war.
</p>

<p>
The most salient points in the life and work
of these two brothers, who close the period
of stiff Gothic medievalism and stand on the
threshold of modern art, and whose improvements
in the technical methods of their art
opened up to their successors unthought-of
possibilities, are shrouded in deep mystery, and
the most recent research to which a number of
thoroughly competent scientific experts have
devoted themselves, whilst producing many
ingenious theories and deductions, has, in a
certain sense, added to the confusion by throwing
doubt upon the authenticity of documents
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
and inscriptions which had formerly passed
undisputed, and formed the basis of the
unstable edifice that had been erected around the
vague fame of the brothers Van Eyck.  This
uncertainty begins with the parentage and the
place and date of birth of the two masters,
and extends to the two supreme achievements
to which they owe their fame&mdash;the reputed
invention of oil-painting, which was variously
ascribed to Hubert and Jan, then denied to
both of them, and, finally, given back to
Hubert in the form of an improvement on the
methods of oil-painting practised during the
period; and the much-quoted inscription on the
famous Ghent altar-piece, <i>The Adoration of the
Lamb</i>, which has been, and must remain, the
starting-point for all research in this matter,
even though the late Henri Bouchot, Keeper
of the Print Cabinet of the Bibliothèque
Nationale, suggests that this inscription may
have been added when the picture was restored
in the middle of the sixteenth century.
At every turn we are faced by similar doubts
and contradictions, especially in the case of
Hubert, about whose life and doings we have so
little documentary evidence that we have to fall
back entirely upon conjecture and deduction.

<h3>
HUBERT VAN EYCK
</h3>

<p>
If Joes van Eyck and Margaret van den
Huntfanghe, who are entered in the register
of the Ghent Guild of Painters for 1391, are the
parents of the two masters who have made the
name of Van Eyck immortal, we should have
proof of their descent from artistic stock, which
may be taken for granted in view of the fact
that not only Hubert and Jan, but also a third
brother, Lambert, and a sister, Margaret,
devoted themselves to the art of painting, though
Lambert&mdash;if he really be responsible for the
pictures which stand to his credit&mdash;was a man
of but mediocre talent; whilst we have no
evidence of the activity of Margaret, who was
most probably a miniaturist or illuminator.
</p>

<p>
It is believed that Hubert (or Huybrecht)
van Eyck was born at Maaseyck, or perhaps
at the village of Eyck near that town, between
1366 and 1370, and that he received his artistic
training either at Cologne or at Maastricht;
but the first definite mention we have of him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
is in Ghent, where he eventually settled, and
where, in 1424, the archives record that he was
paid certain sums for drawings.  Though Mr. Weale
and other authorities hold the view that,
before settling in Ghent, Hubert must have
travelled to the South of Europe, there is
absolutely no evidence to this effect.  The paintings
of the two brothers certainly contain details
which reveal intimate acquaintance with
Southern vegetation and mountain formation;
but, as will be seen later, Mr. Alfred Marks
has fairly well established the fact that the
younger brother, Jan, must be held responsible
for such paintings or portions of paintings as
prove the knowledge of Nature in the South of
Europe.
</p>

<p>
The name of Hubert van Eyck occurs in
two other documents, quoted by Edmond de
Busscher in his "Recherches sur les Peintres
Gantois," but the authenticity of both these
entries has lately been questioned.  The first
of them, which is proved to be a forgery, records
the admission of Hubert and of his sister,
Margaret, into the Confraternity of Our Lady
of the Rays at Ghent in 1419; the other the
affiliation of Hubert and Jan, in 1421, to the
Corporation of Painters and Sculptors of Ghent.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
According to the wording of the latter entry, it
may be gathered that the election of the two
masters was so enthusiastic and unanimous
that the Corporation dispensed with the
conditions and formalities usual on the admission
of free masters to the guild.  This unusual
affiliation, of which the <i>Livre du Métier
Gantois</i> does not reveal another example, is
there quoted as a homage rendered to the
memory of Michelle de France, Countess of
Flanders, and first wife of Philip the Good,
who appears to have held the two brothers in
special favour.  The Corporation, in thus granting
to them the professional franchise of Ghent,
at the same time expressed their esteem for
their talent, and the pious remembrance in
which they held the memory of their Queen
Consort.
</p>

<p>
Of Hubert's early work we have absolutely
no record, and no picture is known which bears
his signature.  Indeed, the only paintings
which can with absolute certainty be assigned
to him are the great Ghent altar-piece, painted
for Jodoc Vydt, on which he was engaged at
the time of his death, and which was finished
six years later by his brother Jan; and the
shutter of a triptych at the Royal Gallery at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
Copenhagen, which represents Robert Poortier,
of Ghent, protected by St. Anthony, with the
Angel Gabriel on the reverse.  Robert Poortier's
will, made in 1426, a few months before
Hubert's death, mentions this triptych as being
in the master's workshop.  On the internal
evidence of these two authentic works attempts
have been made to trace Hubert's hand in
several other pictures, though their number is
so far restricted to only seven.  It has been
suggested that Hubert may in the earlier years
of his career have devoted himself to miniature
painting; and the wonderful Turin miniatures
published by M. Paul Durrieu in the <i>Gazette
des Beaux-Arts</i> (January and February, 1903),
which date from the same period, show such
marked kinship with Hubert's conception and
style that they may well be the work of his
own hand.  The scarcity of his paintings would
thus be accounted for if, anterior to the
experiments which led to the invention of the new
method of oil-painting about 1410, Hubert had
exercised his rare gifts in a different field.
</p>

<p>
From the wording of his epitaph, which has
been handed down to us, it is made clear that
Hubert died on September 18, 1426.  As translated
by Sir Charles Eastlake, in his "Materials
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
for a History of Oil-Painting," this epitaph
runs as follows: "Take warning from me, ye
who walk over me.  I was as you are, but am
now buried dead beneath you.  Thus it appears
that neither art nor medicine availed me.  Art,
honour, wisdom, power, affluence, are not
spared when death comes.  I was called
Hubert van Eyck; I am now food for worms.
Formerly known and highly honoured in painting,
this was all shortly after turned to nothing.
It was in the year of the Lord one thousand
four hundred and twenty-six, on the eighteenth
day of September, that I rendered up my soul
to God, in sufferings.  Pray God for me, ye
who love art, that I may attain to His sight.
Flee sin, turn to the best, for you must follow
me at last."  Hubert was buried in the crypt
of the Cathedral of St. Bavo at Ghent.  When,
owing to some structural alterations to the
church, this crypt was destroyed, the tombs,
including Hubert's, were removed and the
bones dispersed.  Only Hubert's right arm
was placed in an iron case and exhibited as a
relic.

<h3>
JAN VAN EYCK
</h3>

<p>
The date of Jan van Eyck's birth is as
uncertain as that of his brother's.  Tradition
has it that the two brothers are portrayed on the
panel of the great Ghent altar-piece, which
represents <i>The Just Judges</i>.  These portraits
suggest a difference of about twenty years
between the two, so that the birth of Jan would
have to be placed somewhere between 1386 and
1390.  Hubert being thus about twenty years
his senior, it is natural to suppose that Jan
received from him his early education in matters
of art.  Guicciardini, van Mander, and other
early writers, affirm that the two brothers
worked in collaboration, and there is no reason
to doubt that Jan in his early years assisted his
brother in many or most of his paintings&mdash;perhaps
even in the Ghent altar-piece, which
he finished after the elder brother's death.  It
is certainly a curious fact that, with a single
exception&mdash;the completely over-painted
<i>Enthronement of St. Thomas of Canterbury</i> at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
Chatsworth&mdash;all the signed pictures by Jan bear
dates posterior to the death of Hubert.  And
it is equally significant that the first of this
series of ten signed pictures is dated 1432, the
year of the completion of the Ghent altar-piece,
which was the last work in which both brothers
had a share.

THE ENTHRONEMENT OF THOMAS À BECKET, <br>
BY JAN VAN EYCK.
</p>

<p>
The chief events in the life of Jan van Eyck
can be gathered fairly accurately from
contemporary records and documents.  In 1422
Jan entered the service of John of Bavaria, at
that time Duke of Luxembourg, whose household
accounts show the payment of a weekly
wage to the artist, from October 25, 1422, till
September, 1424, for the decoration of the
palace at the Hague.  M. Bouchot mentioned
an earlier record of Jan's doings, when he
believed he discovered him at Cambrai
decorating a Paschal candle.  But the eminent
French critic probably confused Jan van Eyck
with one Jan de Yeke, whose name occurs in
the accounts of the Cathedral of Cambrai as
that of a man employed in 1422 and many
following years in painting crosses, clocks, and
candles on the outer wall of the cathedral to
deter the passers-by from committing nuisances!
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1425 Jan van Eyck was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
appointed <i>varlet de chambre</i> to Philip the Good,
and though this princely patron availed himself
of the master's services as a painter, it would
appear from a letter signed by Philip, and
bearing the date March 12, 1434, that the
appointment of Jan to the position of Court
painter to the Burgundian Prince only took
place in that year (1434).  Still, as <i>varlet de
chambre</i> Jan van Eyck must have enjoyed a
position of considerable trust and emolument
at the hands of his august master, for on more
than one occasion we find him entrusted with
important missions, some of which took him
to the Portuguese Court.  The first of these
excursions took place when he had resided for
three months at Bruges.  On his return he
went at Philip's order to live at Lille, where
he remained until 1428.  His missions were
generally of a secret nature, but on one of these
occasions, in the year 1428, we find Jan again
absent in Portugal, returning to the Court of
Philip in the suite of Isabella of Portugal, who
was destined to become the royal consort.
Gachard, in the <i>Collection de Documents Inédits
concevnant l'Histoire de Belgique</i>, gives a detailed
account of the artist's movements from his
departure from Écluse on October 19, 1428, to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
return in January, 1430.  According to these
dates, which are gathered from contemporary
documents, the ambassadors with the Infanta set
out from Lisbon on October 8, 1429.  The apparent
discrepancy between these dates and that
of January 10, 1429, which, at the Golden Fleece
Exhibition at Bruges in 1907, was given as the
date of the foundation of this Order, and
consequently of the nuptials of Philip and Isabella
and of Jan's return to Bruges, is easily
accounted for if we remember that the beginning
of the year was then reckoned from March 1,
so that January, 1430, of our own reckoning
would tally with January, 1429, of the
contemporary calendar.
</p>

<p>
Jan's first duty on arrival at the Portuguese
Court was to paint the portrait of the Princess.
It appears that he was at work upon this
picture for a month.  Several portraits of
Isabella are still extant painted in the manner
of the van Eycks, and pointing to the same
origin, but none has so far been discovered to
possess qualities or details which would justify
its identification as Jan's original panel.
Evidently Jan's portrait was pleasing to the eye of
the Lowland monarch, for upon Philip expressing
his satisfaction with the personal appearance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
of Isabella, the ambassadors and the bride
immediately embarked on the homeward
journey.  Soon after his return&mdash;namely, in
1431&mdash;Jan bought a house in Bruges, where he
married and continued to work, after the
completion of the Ghent altar-piece in the following
year, until his death, which took place about
the end of June, 1441.  He was buried in the
churchyard of St. Donatian at Bruges, but his
body was subsequently removed to a vault
near the font of that church.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weale, while arranging the archives
of St. Donatian at Bruges, discovered in the
account of the fabric of the church for the year
beginning June 25, 1440, and ending June 24,
1441, entries of sums received for the grave of
Jan van Eyck and for the ringing of the funeral
bell, and in the obituary of the church his
anniversary set down as celebrated on July 9.
In an article in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i> (1904)
Mr. Weale makes the following comment:
"Hence it appears certain that he died on
July 9, 1440.  This date, now generally
accepted, is, however, incorrect.  Two entries
in the account of Walter Poulain,
Receiver-General of Flanders for the year ending
December 31, 1441, prove that John's death
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
took place in 1441, but leave the exact day
uncertain."  Three entries show that Jan died
about the end of June, and that on July 22 a
grant of 360 livres&mdash;the equivalent of her
husband's salary for half a year&mdash;was made to
Jan's widow by the Duke Philip in recognition
of the services rendered by her deceased
husband.  It also shows that Jan's wife was
named Margaret, and that he left at least two
children&mdash;one, the Duke's godchild, Philip or
Philippina, born in June, 1434; the other,
Lyennie, who became a nun at Maaseyck in
1449, which lends colour to the theory that
Maaseyck was her father's birthplace.
</p>

<p>
His epitaph, as translated by Sir Charles
Eastlake, runs: "Here lies Joannes, who was
celebrated for his surpassing skill, and whose
felicity in painting excited wonder.  He painted
breathing forms, and the earth's surface,
covered with flowery vegetation, completing
each work to the life.  Hence Phidias and
Apelles must give place to him, and Polycletus
be considered his inferior in art.  Call,
therefore, the Fates most cruel, who have snatched
from us such a man.  Yet cease to weep, for
destiny is immutable; pray only now to God
that he may live in heaven."

<h3>
THE INVENTION OF OIL-PAINTING
</h3>

<p>
Tradition has for centuries connected the
name of Van Eyck with the invention of
oil-painting, and has fixed upon the year 1410
as the date of this invention.  This, at least,
is the year given by such early writers as
Guicciardini, Vasari, Opmeer, and Karel van
Mander.  Vasari, indeed, gives a most
detailed and circumstantial account of this
epoch-making event, which, according to the Aretine
biographer, was brought about by the single-handed
efforts of Jan.  And it is easy to
understand that the fame of the elder brother
had in the sixteenth century become obscured
and merged in that of the brilliantly successful
Jan, the <i>varlet de chambre</i> and official Court
painter.  This "Giovanni of Bruggia," Vasari
tells us, "after having given extreme labour
to the completion of a certain picture, and with
great diligence brought it to a successful issue,
he gave it the varnish and set it to dry in the
sun, as is the custom.  But whether because
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
the heat was too violent, or that the wood was
badly joined or insufficiently seasoned, the
picture gave way at the joinings, opening
in a very deplorable manner.  Thereupon
Giovanni, perceiving the mischief done to his
work by the heat of the sun, determined to
proceed in such a manner that the same thing
should never again injure his work in like
manner.  And as he was no less embarrassed
by his varnishes than by the process of
tempera-painting, he turned his thoughts to the
discovery of some sort of varnish that would dry
in the shadow, to the end that he need not
expose his pictures to the sun.  Accordingly,
after having made many experiments on
substances, pure and mixed, he finally discovered
that linseed oil and oil of nuts dried more
readily than any others of all that he had tried.
Having boiled these oils, therefore, with other
mixtures, he thus obtained the varnish which
he&mdash;or, rather, all the painters of the world&mdash;had
so long desired.  He made experiments
with many other substances, but finally
decided that mixing the colours with these oils
gave a degree of firmness to the work which
not only secured it against all injury from
water when once dried, but also imparted so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
much life to the colours that they exhibited a
sufficient lustre in themselves without the aid
of varnish; and what appeared to him more
extraordinary than all besides was that the
colours thus treated were much more easily
united and blent than when in tempera."
</p>

<p>
Vasari then proceeds to tell us of Jan's great
success, of the "blameless envy" of all other
artists in Flanders and abroad, from whom he
would jealously guard his secret, until, in his
old age, he imparted it to "his disciple Ruggieri
da Bruggia," a name which surely can hide no
other personality than Rogier van der Weyden's.
Of Hubert never a mention, save a short
reference in the last volume, in the chapter on
"Divers Flemish Artists."  As in most of
Vasari's anecdotes, there is probably a foundation
of truth to the elaborate network of fiction.
The incident explained by him at great length
may have occurred, but its hero can only have
been Hubert, and not Jan, who was then a
mere youth working in his brother's <i>bottega</i>,
and may have assisted Hubert in his
experiments.  Though it has since been doubted that
Hubert or Jan van Eyck actually invented
oil-painting, no evidence has yet been discovered
to prove they were not the first to employ oil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
as a medium in putting colour on the prepared
panel.  It is true that oil as a protective
varnish was frequently used during the
fourteenth century, and it is probable that some
kind of oil-colour was employed in the colouring
of statuary and in the painting of banners at
an early period.  For this reason the statement
that Hubert and Jan van Eyck "discovered
painting in oils" has been disputed, and
generally accepted as inaccurate, but the
question is one rather of terminology than of the
technical point.
</p>

<p>
As the term "oil-painting" is generally
accepted to-day, it is fairer to credit these
brothers with the invention, than to speak of
their achievement as an improvement in
oil-painting, for hitherto the medium in common
use had been a preparation of gum and white
of eggs.  And as there is neither definite proof
nor any good evidence that oil had ever been used
as a <i>medium to mix the colours</i> for panel-painting
before Hubert and Jan made their experiments,
we surely have an easy distinction to draw.
The brothers Van Eyck were the first successfully
to mix the oil with the colours for
painting, and this process is what we now
understand as "painting in oils."  The use of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
oils as a protective or varnish does not enter
into the painting, since such had only been
used on the completion of the work.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, the brothers either acted
more generously than Vasari would have it, or
they did not altogether succeed in guarding
their precious secret, for their method appears
to have been fairly generally practised at
Ghent about 1420.  We find, for instance,
that in 1419 the "free painters," Willem van
Appoele and Johannes Maertens, received a
commission to paint some pictures for the
town hall of Ghent in "good oil-colours."  It
is also certain that Rogier van der
Weyden&mdash;Vasari's Ruggieri da Bruggia&mdash;never was a
pupil of either Jan or Hubert van Eyck.

<h3>
THE ART OF THE VAN EYCKS
</h3>

<p>
The position occupied by Hubert and Jan
van Eyck in the history of art is one of
unparalleled importance.  A deep gulf divides
them from all their immediate precursors, who
seem to belong altogether to a different
epoch&mdash;nay, a different world.  Just as their
improvement in the technical methods of their
craft opened up a vista of till then unthought
of possibilities, so their conception
of life and of pictorial form marks the beginning
of a new era, the passing of the vague
mediæval idealism into an art that is based
upon the close study and loving appreciation
of Nature.  Perhaps too much stress has
been laid upon the so-called "realism" of the
brothers van Eyck, and more especially of Jan.
Again and again critics have insisted upon
Jan's uncompromising love of literal truth,
upon his insistence on details that are in
themselves at times repulsively ugly.  This realism
was tempered with deep sentiment and a sense
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
of style which kept such details well subordinated
to the general scheme, and it is in this
respect that Jan van Eyck stands immeasurably
above Melchior Broederlam, who occupied the
position of <i>varlet de chambre</i> and Court painter
to Philip the Bold, the grandfather of Jan's
patron.  Broederlam, indeed, as may be seen
in his famous altar-piece at Dijon, seems to be
a far more pronounced realist than Jan van
Eyck, simply because he lacks that sense of
style and harmony and subordination&mdash;in short,
that concentration&mdash;which makes us forget the
realistic detail in the beauty of the complete
thing.
</p>

<p>
The real precursors of the van Eycks were the
sculptors who carved the tombs, monuments, and
reliefs in the churches of Tournai.  In these
we first find the faithful adherence to the facts
of Nature and the understanding of the subtleties
of form which in painting appear first in the
works of the brothers van Eyck, who may
have also owed much of their knowledge to the
flourishing school of Flemish miniature-painters,
if, indeed, Hubert in his early days did not
actually practise this art.  Yet, even though
the new era in painting is, as it were, heralded
by the new tendencies in plastic art&mdash;just as in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
Italy Giotto was preceded by the sculptor Niccolo
Pisani&mdash;there is something wonderful, something
almost difficult to realise, in the sudden
appearance of complete and perfect works of
art, like the paintings of the van Eycks, that
with masterly sureness express the whole
essence of the Gothic style, whilst at the same
time they reveal a new understanding of the
inexhaustible beauty of Nature, a keen perception
of structural growth and of individual
characteristics, and, above all, an almost modern
understanding of the play of light upon figures
and objects in and out of doors.
</p>

<p>
The picturesque, brilliant, varied life of such
cities as Bruges and Ghent at the beginning of
the fifteenth century cannot have failed to
stimulate the artists' power of observation, to
sharpen their perception of the differences of
race, gesture, and costume; for the streets and
squares of the rich commercial centres of
Flanders were filled from morning to night
with ever-moving crowds of courtiers and
merchants from all parts of the world&mdash;Spaniards
and Italians, Germans, and Slavonians, and
even Moors and Turks, all in their different
costumes and following their different customs.
At the same time the painters' eyes were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
constantly met by the wonders of the creations of
architects, armourers, and other craftsmen who
flourished under the protection of the
Burgundian rulers; and one may well understand the
love and enthusiasm with which a receptive
artist like Jan van Eyck applied himself to the
faithful delineation of the splendours and of the
seething life by which he was surrounded.
</p>

<p>
Although the two brothers were in the habit
of working together upon the same pictures,
which has given rise to many disputes as to the
authorship of unsigned works, and although
Jan, the realist, at times approached, though
never equalled, the spirituality and decorative
sumptuousness of Hubert, whilst Hubert,
the stylist and greater mind of the two,
sometimes vied with Jan in the minute and
exquisite elaboration of details, the signed works
of Jan and those parts of the Ghent altar-piece
which are unquestionably Hubert's own have
made it possible to characterise the distinguishing
qualities of the two masters.  Hubert far
exceeds his brother in monumental impressiveness,
in grandeur of style, in idealistic significance,
in sumptuousness, and even in sense of
beauty.  Even the folds of his draperies have a
fulness and a noble swing which form a striking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
contrast to the more laboured irregularity of
Jan's, as may be seen in comparing the
garments of God the Father, the Virgin Mary, and
St. John, of the Ghent altar-piece, with the
curiously broken folds of Barbara's dress in
Jan's picture at Antwerp.

<br>
THE MAN WITH THE PINKS. <br>
BY JAN VAN EYCK.
</p>

<p>
The conception of such ideas as are embodied
in the <i>Adoration of the Lamb</i>, or in the
<i>Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue</i>, at the
Madrid Museum, would also have been quite
beyond the pale of the more prosaic Jan's
imagination.  Jan, on the other hand, excelled
in stating the reality of the visible world.
Generalisations of human types or of landscape
features are unknown to him.  He was the
first to fix upon his panels all the carefully
studied and exquisitely wrought details of the
actual world&mdash;sky and mountain and river, forest
and fields, flowers and trees, and the churches
and castles, houses and bridges, placed in
Nature by human hands.  It is scarcely too
much to say that he was the first landscape-painter,
just as he was the first portrait painter
in the modern sense of the word&mdash;the first
who could paint a scene so that it could be
identified after the lapse of centuries, the first
who could paint a portrait so that the model
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
stands before us living and breathing, in all his
beauty or ugliness.  To appreciate the keenness
of his vision one has only to examine the
marvellous Arnolfini group at the National Gallery,
with its almost scientific treatment of softly
diffused indoor light.  A comparison of this
picture, from the point of view of lighting, with
anything that was painted before the days of
the van Eycks will reveal perhaps the greatest
step forward that is on record in the whole
history of painting.

<h3>
COLLABORATION OF THE BROTHERS
</h3>

<p>
When piecing together the lives of the
brothers van Eyck, it is necessary to
delve into a confusing mass of conflicting
statements&mdash;evidence which is only in part to be
relied upon, and the theories of those who have
devoted a vast amount of time and labour to
the unearthing, sorting, and arranging of such
evidence as they have been able to lay their
hands upon.  Incomplete as the records are,
we must, until further evidence has been
discovered, accept the obvious conclusions from
the indisputable data left to us.
</p>

<p>
We have ten unquestionably genuine signed
pictures by Jan, and a small group of others
which may, from internal evidence, be safely
ascribed to the same source.  We know that
the great <i>Adoration of the Lamb</i>, though
designed in its entirety by Hubert, is the
combined work of the two masters.  We know also
that the Copenhagen panel of Robert Poortier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
was in Hubert's studio at the time of his
death&mdash;perhaps unfinished.  The remaining pictures
generally accepted as genuine van Eycks
have been variously ascribed to Hubert, or to
Jan, or to their united efforts.  In view of
the fact that not a single really authenticated
work by Hubert alone is known, special significance
must be attached to a statement, several
times repeated by early writers, that Hubert
and Jan "continually painted on the same
works."
</p>

<p>
In trying to solve the difficult question which
part of the extant <i>oeuvre</i> is Hubert's and which
is Jan's, our knowledge of Jan's journeys to the
South assumes considerable importance.  For
Hubert's travels we lack proof&mdash;they are mere
conjecture.  But there is documentary evidence
of Jan's journey to Portugal in 1428, in
addition to which Mr. Weale has, I understand,
recently unearthed some further documents
which establish another and earlier journey of
Jan to Spain.  On these travels Jan must have
become well acquainted with certain plants
peculiar to the South, and especially the dwarf
palm or palmetto, which is confined almost
exclusively to Spain and Portugal.  It is
therefore not unreasonable to assign to him those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
portions of the disputed pictures in which this
palmetto appears.  Some authorities hold that
Jan did not have any independent artistic career
before Hubert's death, and that in the division
of labour Hubert's share was, as a rule, the
general design and the painting of the figures,
whilst Jan filled in the landscape and
architectural backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
The collaboration theory has been advanced
by Mr. A. Marks, whose knowledge of Flemish
art is profound, and whose deductions are as
conscientious as they are convincing.  To him
we are indebted for an interesting paper upon
the subject, which is at once exhaustive and
reasonable.  To retail all that Mr. Marks
advances in support of his theory would be to
reprint his treatise <i>in toto</i>; but though it is
impossible here to follow all his arguments,
it is equally impossible to avoid reference to the
valuable correspondence between him and
Mr. James Weale in the <i>Athenæum</i>, between
November, 1902, and April, 1903.  This
correspondence arose from an article by
Mr. A. Marks in the <i>Athenæum</i> in May, 1900, in
which attention is drawn to the presence of the
palmetto in the picture of <i>St. Francis receiving
the Stigmata</i> (now in possession of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
Mr. J. G. Johnson, Pennsylvania; a copy in Turin),
which picture had been formerly variously
ascribed to Henri met de Bles, Joachim Patinier,
and Mostaert.  Mr. Marks has since supplemented
and explained his views in the essay
mentioned; whilst Miss Frances Weale has
published an excellent study on the "van
Eycks," which, in a concise and interesting
form, presents her father's views on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, likely that nothing is proved
as to the authorship of certain paintings by the
presence or absence of the exotic plants or
other details ascribed to one or other of the
brothers.  Supposing the assumed visit of
Hubert to Southern Europe to be a fact, Jan
may have made use of his brother's studies
to embellish his landscapes; or Hubert may
have utilized Jan's studies.  But either supposition
is extremely unlikely.  We have certain
proof that Jan did several times visit the South,
while Hubert's sojourn in these parts is pure
surmise; and not only is it likely that, rather
than make use of second-hand material, Hubert
left portions of the pictures to be painted by
Jan, but the examination of the various pictures
reveals the same hand in the painting of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
recurring details.  We must, then, take the
facts and the most likely deductions in preference
to deductions drawn from data which are merely
conjectural.
</p>

<p>
Documentary evidence proves that Jan,
immediately after his reception by the King of
Portugal on January 12, 1429, began the work
of painting the portrait of the Infanta, which,
by the way, was executed in tempera, and not
in oil.  This painting is, unfortunately, lost,
and though there are several portraits of
Isabella now extant, of which one at least may
be a copy of Jan's picture, there is nothing in
any of them that can be traced to this master.
He took a month over its completion, and
while the Court and Embassy were awaiting
the decision of Philip, to whom the picture had
been sent, Jan and his colleagues had time to
visit several places of interest and people of
distinction.  They travelled to the north to
see the shrine of St. Iago of Compostella; then
to the south, where they were received in turn
by the Duke of Arjona and the King of Castile;
and then to Granada, in the extreme south,
where they visited the King of that city.  It is
stated that they also visited many other places;
and, as from Granada they returned to Lisbon,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
they must have passed through the country
lying between Cordova and Seville.
</p>

<p>
Now, through the whole of the south-eastern
portion of the peninsula the palmetto, or
dwarf-palm, flourishes abundantly, and Jan could not
fail during his tour to become well acquainted
with it.  In a letter which Mr. Marks quotes in
his paper read at the Royal Society of Literature,
June 24, 1903, Mr. Luffmann, Director
of the School of Horticulture in Melbourne,
says that the triangle formed by Seville,
Cordova, and Osuna, is "a piece of country
which is literally overrun by the plant," and
that the root of the palmetto is commonly used
in those parts as fuel.  In Italy it is but of
rare occurrence, though it grows in some of the
islands of the Mediterranean; whilst in the
parts of Spain and Portugal visited by Jan it is
almost impossible for the visitor to avoid
seeing it.
</p>

<p>
Failing, then, even the probability that
Hubert ever saw the palmetto growing, we
must credit Jan with the painting of this plant,
which, like all the other exotics, must have
been carefully studied from nature, for they are
represented in most minute, careful, and
conscientious manner, and are absolutely true to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
life.  The palmetto occurs in the picture of
<i>St. Francis receiving the Stigmata</i> (above referred
to); in the <i>St. Anthony with the Donor</i> at
Copenhagen; and in <i>The Three Marys at the Sepulchre</i>
in the collection of Sir Frederick Cook at
Richmond.  The portions of these paintings by
Hubert van Eyck, where the palmetto occurs,
may therefore be safely ascribed to the hand
of Jan.
</p>

<p>
Other exotic plants, which are not restricted
to Spain and Portugal, occur in these pictures;
but they are painted by the same hand, and
betray the same loving adherence to truth, and
a similar familiarity with the plants as they
grow.  It is therefore patent that they, too,
must be ascribed to Jan, for it is impossible to
suppose that the younger brother's work on
these pictures was simply that of adding the by
no means necessary dwarf-palm to Hubert's
completed landscapes.  Jan was probably
responsible for the design and execution of these
landscapes.  These other exotics also occur in
the Ghent altar-piece, in the <i>Calvary</i> of the
Berlin Museum, and in the copy, at the same
museum, of a lost <i>Virgin and Child</i>, Mr. Marks
produces further evidence to prove that Jan
must have painted not only the foliage, but the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
whole of the landscapes where the little palm
appears, including in most cases the
architecture.  He draws attention to the
architectural features in the <i>Chancellor Rolin with
Saints</i> in the Louvre, and the signed and dated
altar-piece by Jan in the museum at Bruges:
"The architecture in these pictures is not a real
architecture&mdash;that is, it has not been copied
from any actual examples....  Agreement is
general that it is an architecture invented, not
merely copied."  These pictures furnish
evidence of the painter having visited Italy, for
marble is represented in a most lavish manner.
This marble is not characteristic of Northern
architecture; its use is distinctly Italian.  The
painting of it displays the usual care and
conscientiousness common to all Jan's works.
Further points cited by Mr. Marks as evidence
of Jan's work in various pictures are the
representations of snow-mountains in various works,
and the presence of a flying flock of geese.
</p>

<p>
The former is of greater importance, as this
again points to acquaintance with the South,
where alone the painter could have seen
snow-mountains.  Now, as very similar architecture
to that in the altar-piece at Bruges, which is
signed by Jan van Eyck, is found in the <i>Chancellor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
Rolin</i> (Louvre), the <i>Virgin and Child</i> (Dresden),
and the <i>Carthusian Monk with Saints</i> (Gustave
de Rothschild, Paris), the suggestion is clear
that in all these pictures the architecture is the
work of Jan, and several notable critics hold
this view.  In three of these four paintings we
find the snow-mountains&mdash;namely, in the
Dresden triptych, the <i>Chancellor Rolin</i>, and the
<i>Carthusian Monk</i>.  And having established Jan
as the author of these snow-mountains, we
must credit him with the landscapes where this
feature occurs in other pictures&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Ghent
altar-piece, the <i>Crucifixion</i> of the Hermitage in
St. Petersburg, the <i>Calvary</i> of the Berlin
Museum, and the <i>Three Marys</i> of Sir Frederick
Cook.  The theory that Jan is responsible for
the snow-mountains is amply supported by the
very reasonable deduction that he must at some
time have visited Italy.  This is gathered from
the Italian character of the architecture, together
with the snow seen in the Rothschild picture,
the <i>Chancellor Rolin</i>, the <i>Carthusian Monk</i>, and
the Dresden picture.  The theory is further
supported by the presence of the palmetto
together with snow-mountains in the <i>Three
Marys</i> of Sir Frederick Cook.  Here the
palmetto proves the authorship of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
landscape, and as the view contains snow-mountains
it very materially strengthens the supposition
that it was Jan, and not Hubert, who painted
them, and who consequently must have been
to the South of Europe&mdash;probably Italy&mdash;to
have seen them.
</p>

<p>
The flock of geese, which appears in no fewer
than six pictures in addition to Jan's signed
<i>St. Barbara</i> at Antwerp, is of very much less
importance than the snow-mountains and the
palmetto, for here the only use that can be
made of it as evidence is its frequent repetition.
It is found in the landscapes of the Ghent
altar-piece, in the <i>Chancellor Rolin</i>, the
<i>Carthusian Monk</i>, another version of the same
subject in the Berlin Museum, <i>St. Francis receiving
the Stigmata</i>, and in the <i>Three Marys</i>.  But the
flock of wild-geese is not a feature made use of
by the van Eyck brothers only.  It seems to
have been of common occurrence in several
other Flemish painters both before and after
the days of the van Eycks.  Nevertheless, its
presence in the pictures enumerated has been
brought forward as supplementary evidence to
prove the collaboration of Hubert and Jan.
</p>

<br>
ST. BARBARA. <br>
BY JAN VAN EYCK.
</p>

<p>
So far, then, evidence has been shown to
prove Jan's share in the following pictures: the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
<i>Chancellor Rolin</i>, the <i>Virgin and Child</i> (at
Dresden), the <i>Carthusian Monk</i> in the Rothschild
Collection, <i>St. Francis receiving the Stigmata</i>,
<i>St. Anthony and the Donor</i> (at Copenhagen), <i>The
Three Marys at the Sepulchre</i>, the <i>Crucifixion</i> (at
St. Petersburg), the <i>Calvary</i> (at Berlin), and
the great altar-piece at St. Bavo, Ghent.  Still
another point which has been generally urged
to prove collaboration of the two brothers is
the appearance of their portraits in certain
pictures.  They are seen in the panel of the
Ghent altar-piece representing the <i>Just Judges</i>,
in the copy of the lost <i>Fountain of Life</i> or <i>The
Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue</i> in the
Madrid Museum, and also, it is said, in the
<i>Crucifixion</i> of St. Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
Though the theory of collaboration is an old
one, doubts have arisen amongst modern critics,
who have shown a growing tendency to ascribe
the majority of the unsigned works solely to
the elder brother, which attribution is refuted
not only by the arguments here set forth, but
by many early writers, including Guicciardini
and van Mander, both notable and reliable
historians.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the question of collaboration,
a few words must be said concerning the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
controversy that has arisen over the Ghent
altar-piece.  This painting is indisputably the
masterpiece of the van Eycks, and is of
stupendous proportions.  The panel of the
<i>Adoration of the Lamb</i>, from which the whole
alter-piece takes its name, and the shutters
depicting the <i>Just Judges</i>, the <i>Warriors of Christ</i>,
the <i>Holy Hermits</i>, and the <i>Holy Pilgrims</i>, have
by many critics been attributed to Hubert's
unaided efforts.  It is therefore interesting to
examine the landscape backgrounds of these
five panels, and to consider them in the light
of the evidence deduced from the backgrounds
of the other "collaboration" pictures.
Evidence is needed to prove that Jan's work was
not merely confined to finishing the picture
after his brother's death (the inscription states
that it was begun by Hubert and finished by
Jan), which in itself, of course, does not prove
collaboration of the brothers.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, Jan's handiwork must be
identified.  In the pictures already discussed
it has been proved fairly conclusively that Jan
is responsible for the painting of the exotic
plants, the snow-mountains, the flock of wild
geese, and the architectural setting.  The
landscapes in the Ghent altar-piece contain exotic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
plants, wild geese, and snow-mountains.  Of
the latter it is difficult to speak; they are
whitish in colour, but their formation is neither
so natural nor so well designed as in the <i>Three
Marys</i>.  The exotic plants alone prove Jan's
work here.  The birds may, or may not, be
very important.  They serve, however, by
their repeated appearance in Jan's other
pictures, as auxiliary evidence.  The question
for proof, however, is not the presence of Jan's
work on this picture, but the presence of his
work before the death of his brother.  And
from this point of view it is significant that,
though other exotics are present in profusion,
the palmetto&mdash;a sure result of Jan's visit to
Portugal&mdash;does not appear.  The whole work
is stated in the inscription to have been finished
on May 6, 1432, two years after Jan's return
from Portugal.  Now, the absence of the
palmetto from this picture points to one of two
conclusions&mdash;either the work left for Jan to do
in the completion was comparatively trifling,
or that the greater part of the picture, including
the design of the landscapes, was already
finished before Jan met with the palmetto.
</p>

<p>
That the work of the younger brother was
not insignificant is distinctly stated in the text
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
of the inscription: "The painter, Hubert van
Eyck, greater than whom none is to be found,
began [the work]; the bulk was completed by
his brother Jan, second to him in art, relying
on the request of Jodoc Vydt.  This verse
invites you to contemplate that which was
completed on May 6, 1432."  This translation
from the Latin is chosen from three versions.
The other renderings seem to be given by those
who would translate the word <i>pondus</i> as <i>work</i>,
and thus give the younger brother credit for
no more than finishing an incomplete picture.
The text has, however, been translated by
several learned scholars, who are entirely free
from the taint of partisanship, and it is now
generally agreed that the translation given
here is the correct one.
</p>

<p>
There is yet another possibility which the
absence of the palmetto points to&mdash;namely, that
the picture was practically finished before Jan's
visit to Portugal, save some very minor details,
which were completed in 1432, The presence
of the other exotics points to this view being
correct, for it would obviously be unlikely that
Jan should omit the palmetto from all these
five landscapes after his careful studies of his
favourite plant.  The other exotics, not being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
a result of the journey, may very well have
been painted before 1429.  Collaboration in
this work is further proved by the portraits of
the two brothers.

<h3>
OUR ILLUSTRATIONS
</h3>

<p>
The supreme masterpiece of the brothers
van Eyck, the work which, in the history
of Flemish art, has played the part that was
allotted to Masaccio's frescoes at the Carmine,
Florence, in the art of Italy, is the gigantic
polyptych painted for the chapel of the Vydt
family in the Cathedral of St. John (now
St. Bavo) in Ghent, and known from the subject
of the chief panel as the <i>Adoration of the Lamb</i>.
In its original form this altar-piece, which is
now divided between St. Bavo Cathedral and
the museums of Berlin and Brussels, was
composed of twelve interior panels and a predella
(which has unfortunately been destroyed).
Including the backs of the shutters, which, like
the panels themselves, are covered with the
most minute and exquisite painting, the painted
surface extends to over 1,000 square feet.  The
centre panel alone, from which the whole altar-piece
takes its name, measures 7¼ feet in width
by 4½ feet in height.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
</p>

<p>
Horizontally the whole altar-piece is divided
into three portions.  The central panel of
the middle tier is occupied by the <i>Adoration of
the Lamb</i>.  Like the rest of the picture, it is
treated in a decorative spirit, the grouping of
the figures, the architecture, and the foliage
being almost geometrically arranged and
balanced.  In a very beautiful and peaceful
landscape is set up, on a green mound in the
centre, an altar, upon which stands the Lamb
of God.  Its breast is pierced in the customary
manner, the sacred blood flowing into a chalice
at its feet.  Immediately around the altar
fourteen angels, symbolical, probably, of the
stations of the Passion of Christ, kneel in
adoration.  The two in front of the altar offer
incense, while emblems of the Passion are held
by others.  The cross is held on the left, and
the pillar of the scourging stands on the right.
In the foreground, also in the centre and below
the altar, is the Fountain of Life, which divides
two groups of worshippers: on the left are the
Jewish prophets and patriarchs of the Old
Testament, whilst the crowd on the right is
composed of Popes, Bishops, priests, monks,
and laymen.  In the background, emerging
from the luxuriant forest immediately behind
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
the altar, two processions slowly wend their
way.  The group on the right is composed of
holy women, foremost of whom come St. Agnes
with a lamb, St. Catherine, and others.  The
Procession on the left again includes Popes,
Bishops, and monks.  These are said to be the
confessors.  Above all hovers the Holy Ghost
in the form of the dove.
</p>

<p>
The painting of these figures is most exquisite.
The draperies are soft and pleasing;
the colour is deep and rich; while the faces are
remarkable for their character and variety of
expression.  The jewels and ornaments worn
by some of the Popes and Bishops are drawn
with loving care, and the enrichments of the
vestments betray a patience and skill that
create wonder.  In the distance, above the trees,
are seen cities with many towers and churches,
behind which are hills in the remote distance.
The foreground of the beautiful, soft, spring-like
grass is profusely enriched by the growth
of innumerable flowers and shrubs, all of which
are painted with consummate skill and truth.
The whole picture makes a profound effect by
its sumptuous splendour, and by the masterly
disposal of light and shade.
</p>

<p>
The two panels on the left are the <i>Just Judges</i>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
and <i>Christ's Warriors</i>.  In the <i>Judges</i> the whole
lower half of the picture is taken up by figures
on horses.  Behind a cliff in the middle distance
is seen a forest and some buildings of elaborate
architecture, which may represent tribunals.
The bridles and trappings of the horses are
richly jewelled, and altogether the best is made
of the opportunity of rendering with goldsmith-like
precision all manner of gorgeous materials,
costly and beautifully emblazoned banners, and
armour and trappings of beautiful design.
Tradition has it that two of the <i>Judges</i> are
portraits of the painters, the one in a black
garment with a red rosary, who is turning
towards the spectator, being the younger brother
Jan.  To strengthen the theory that this figure
was painted by Jan after Hubert's death,
Mr. Weale suggests that the black habit and red
rosary denote mourning, probably for his
brother Hubert.
</p>

<p>
As regards the other panel, Mr. Six has
advanced an interesting theory with respect to
the soldier who wears a blue head-dress.  He
calls attention to a <i>pentimento</i> in substituting
for a crown on this figure the blue head-dress.
Mr. Six claims to have identified this figure as
Jean Sans Peur, who probably saw the painting,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
and objected to being represented with a crown
while Godfrey de Bouillon wore only a fur cap,
and therefore persuaded the painter to alter it
to the blue cap or bonnet which was the badge
of the Burgundians against the Armagnacs.
From this the supposed alteration must have
taken place a little after 1410, whereas, according
to early art historians, the altar-piece was
only begun between 1415 and 1420.

</p>

<p>
Though the limitations of the present little
volume make it impossible to reproduce the
other panels which originally formed part of
the colossal altar-piece, it will not be out of
place here to describe them in detail, as they
all form part of a wonderfully complete and
harmonious scheme.  As pendants to the <i>Judges</i>
and <i>Warriors</i>, to the right of the central panel
were the <i>Holy Hermits</i> and the <i>Holy Pilgrims</i>.
Rocks, cliff, and foliage are found in the
background of the hermits, but, as suggestive of
retirement and remoteness, no architecture is
seen.  The pilgrims are represented walking up
a valley towards the spectator.  On the right,
in the background, is a hill covered with
various trees, and in the distance is seen a
river and meadows, with a town and low hills
beyond.  The pilgrims are led by St. Christopher,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
whose giant proportions tower above the rest
of the procession.
</p>

<p>
The upper tier of the polyptych consists of
seven panels, or rather three panels, the
combined width of which corresponds with that of
the <i>Adoration</i> panel below, and two shutters on
each side.  The grand figure in the centre
panel, majestically enthroned, has been
variously held to represent God the Father
and Christ, and the Latin inscription may be
equally applied to both.  Perhaps it was the
painter's idea to personify both in one figure.
On His brow is the Crown of Heaven, and at
His feet the Crown of Purity and Innocence,
which the Lamb has won on earth.  The panel
to His right shows the Virgin, gazing in devotion
at an open book in her hands&mdash;a conception
of such purity and innocence that it recalls the
spirit of Fra Angelico.  To his left is the
equally nobly conceived figure of St. John, an
open book in his lap, with his right hand raised,
as it were, in exhortation.  The monumental
style of these figures, and their deep significance,
leave no doubt that these panels are from the
brush of the elder brother Hubert.
</p>

<p>
These panels are flanked by two shutters on
each side&mdash;a choir of angels and St. Cecilia
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
with some angels within, and <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>
at the extreme ends.  The relentless realism of
the latter, which borders close on ugliness,
marks them as the work of Jan.  The figures
are undoubtedly painted from life, and were
held to be so wonderful that for some time the
whole altar-piece was known as the "Adam
and Eve painting."  Jan may also be held
responsible for the angels and St. Cecilia, both
of which have many characteristics that tally
with well-authenticated works by the master.
The predella which originally adorned the
altar-piece has unfortunately been destroyed.
The reverse of the lower shutters shows the
figures of St. John the Evangelist, St. John the
Baptist, and portraits of the donor, Jodoc Vydt,
and his wife; and of the upper shutters, the
Annunciation and figures of prophets and
sibyls.  Only the <i>Adoration</i> and the three
important panels above (God the Father, the
Virgin, and St. John) remain at the Cathedral
of St. Bavo at Ghent; the <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> are
now at the Brussels Museum, and the other
shutters at the Berlin Museum.
</p>

<p>
There are still extant portions of a copy of
this great work which was painted at the
command of Philip II. of Spain by Michael
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
Cocxie.  The wings of this copy are now added
to the original centre portion at Ghent.  There
is a second copy of the Ghent altar-piece in the
museum of Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
Upon the consecration of the great masterpiece
at St. Bavo vast multitudes of people
came into the city to see the work, the fame of
which soon became known throughout the
whole of Western Europe.  And for more than
four centuries it remained the wonder of Ghent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. R. Petrucci states that in 1904, during
a demolition of a house in the Rue du Gouvernement
at Ghent, the old walls were discovered
of a Steen believed to have been the property
of Jodoc Vydt, the patron of the van Eycks,
who commissioned them to execute the Ghent
polyptych.  In a room upon the third floor,
40 feet up, a square window was discovered
exactly answering in orientation and position
to the town which appears in the <i>Adoration of
the Lamb</i>, and which has been recognised as a
view over the Rue Courte du Jour.  In the
foreground is seen the Steen, on the site of
which was afterwards built the little butcher's
shop near the present bird-market.  Above it
rises the tournelle of the weavers' chapel, which
was used in turn as a butcher's shop, a pleasure
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
resort, and a place of auction, and is now a
garage for motor-cars.  Further away, in the
background, is the old fortified gate which
defended the passage of the bridge of the canal
of the coppersmiths.  On the left of the scene
is a representation of another front of the Steen,
which stood on that side at the corner of the
Rue Courte du Jour and the Rue de Brabant.
The window reveals this scene exactly.  "It
seems certain," says Mr. Petrucci, "that this
was the room in which Hubert and Jan, or, at
any rate, Jan, van Eyck painted the famous
polyptych of the Mystic Lamb."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The portrait group by Jan van Eyck known
as <i>Jan Arnolfini and Jeanne dc Chenany, his Wife</i>,
must be counted among the greatest treasures
of the London National Gallery, as it is,
perhaps, the most perfect as well as the most
characteristic example of the master's art.
Arnolfini, who was Jan's brother-in-law, a man
of solemn and depressing countenance, with
heavy, drooping lids and long, wide-nostrilled
nose, is seen standing in his bed-chamber.
His right hand is raised as if enjoining silence,
his left extended to his wife, whose open
countenance denotes docility and calm.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
Arnolfini wears a tunic of a dark green stuff,
over which is a cloak of dark red, which reaches
well below the knees, and is lined and edged
with fur.  It is divided at the sides from the
bottom to the shoulder.  He wears a large and
curiously shaped hat, which in a manner
resembles a "beefeater's" head-gear.  His
wife is habited in a long and ample robe of
green, rather bright in colour, and lined and
trimmed with white fur.  She has raised the
folds of the robe in front, thus revealing an
undergarment of dark blue, trimmed also with
fur.  Round her strikingly high waist is a
narrow belt of leather, decorated with gilding
and polished.  On her head is a large kerchief
with a worked border, which is caught up at
the sides in the prevailing fashion.  Round her
neck she wears a double row of pearls.  The
drawing of the drapery, which falls straight to
the floor, is bold and severe, realistic, and
devoid of any attempt at affectation.
</p>

<p>
In the foreground is a small dog, and to the
left, on the floor, a pair of pattens.  In the
centre of the room, slightly behind and above
the heads of the figures, hangs a brass
chandelier of pierced work.  Of its six arms only
one holds a candle, and this is burning, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
single flame being probably a symbol of
conjugal affection or unity, as there is no other
reason for its presence in a chamber well lit by
two large windows on the left&mdash;one behind the
figures and one in advance, which is not shown,
but the light from which falls straight upon the
faces.  On the wall behind the two figures a
circular convex mirror reflects a portion of the
room, with two additional figures.  Beside it
hangs an amber rosary.  The flesh painting is
admirably soft, delicate, and transparent; the
light and shade powerful, yet so well arranged
that only the closest examination will reveal
what an important factor it is in the success of
the picture.  The whole thing is touching in
the simple straightforwardness of statement,
and all the details are wrought with inimitable
but unobtrusive minute precision.  In the
management of tone-values and of indoors
atmosphere Jan proves himself in this picture
far ahead of his time.
</p>

<p>
The signature of this Arnolfini picture is
written in ornamental Gothic characters
immediately above the mirror, and takes the
extraordinary form "Johannes de Eyck fuit hic"
(Jan van Eyck was here), with the date 1434.
Owing to this ambiguous wording, which may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
be, and has been, interpreted as "this was Jan
van Eyck," the picture was formerly held to
represent the artist himself and his wife, a theory
which still has its defenders.  A full pedigree
of the picture is given in the National Gallery
catalogue.  It belonged in 1516 to Margaret of
Austria, to whom it was given by Don Diego
de Guevara, whose arms were painted on the
shutters which were originally attached to it.
Afterwards it passed into the hands of a
barber-surgeon at Bruges, who presented it to the
then Regent of the Netherlands, Mary, the
sister of Charles V., and Queen Dowager of
Hungary.  This Princess valued the picture so
highly that she granted the barber-surgeon in
return a pension, or office, worth 100 florins
per annum.  The picture is included in the list
of valuables which she carried with her to
Spain in 1556, from which date it disappeared
until 1815, when it was discovered by
Major-General Hay in the apartments to which he
was taken, in Brussels, to recover from wounds
received at Waterloo.  He subsequently
purchased the picture, and disposed of it to the
British Government in 1842, since which date
it has been at the National Gallery.  Henri
Bouchot was of opinion that the picture is not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
the one of Arnolfini the traces of which are
lost in 1556, but a portrait of van Eyck and
his wife, painted as a pendant to the lost
Arnolfini group.  To support his view he
pointed out the resemblance of the woman in
this picture with the portrait of Jan's wife at
the Bruges Museum.

<br>
PORTRAIT OF TIMOTHY. <br>
BY JAN VAN EYCK.
</p>

<p>
The portrait at the National Gallery which,
from the name inscribed in Greek characters
on the stone parapet that extends across the
bottom of the panel, is known as the bust of
Timothy, bears the date October 10, 1432,
and is therefore the earliest of Jan's signed and
dated pictures&mdash;always excepting the
much-overpainted Chatsworth panel of 1421.  It is
not in quite so good a state of preservation as
the other portrait of a man by Jan, in the
same Gallery, which is dated 1433, but the face
itself is in fairly good condition.  The features
are broad and massive, and inclined to
heaviness; the eyes are somewhat deep-set, while
the cheek-bones are prominent.  His right
hand holds a small roll of parchment with
some writing upon it.  On the parapet, beneath
the Greek word "Tymotheos," is the inscription
LEAL SOVVENIR, and the signature
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
"Factū año. Dm&#772;. 1432. 10. die Octobris. a
Joh. de Eyck."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The portrait known as <i>The Man with the
Pinks</i> at the Berlin Museum, is one of the
most characteristic of Jan's portraits.  It shows
an elderly man in a dark grey coat with fur
cuffs and collar and a broad-brimmed beaver
hat.  At the neck the brocade collar of a tunic
shows above the fur collar of the coat.  The
ornament of this brocade seems to consist of
the alternating letters Y and C, which occur in
one or two other portraits of the period, and
may eventually afford some clue as to the
identity of the sitter.  Round the neck is a
twisted wire chain, from which hangs a headless
cross and the bell of St. Anthony.  Both hands
are raised as high as the breast, the fingers and
thumb of the left holding three pinks.  A handsome
ring with two stones is on the third finger.
The face, wrinkled and lined, is full of expression
and life; the lips are parted, as though
about to give utterance to speech.  Though
the drawing is almost hard in its exact delineation,
it is far from rigid.  It is altogether an
admirable example of Jan's lifelike realism,
that loves to dwell on every little ugly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
detail&mdash;ill-shapen ears, puffy "tear-bags," warts and
wrinkles&mdash;and yet infuses the whole thing with
the beauty of life and character.

<br>
THE VAN DER PAELE ALTAR-PIECE. <br>
BY JAN VAN EYCK.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Virgin and Child, with St. Donatian,
St. George, and the Donor, George van der Paele</i>,
Canon of the ancient Cathedral of St. Donatian
at Bruges, bears the date 1436, and is the
most important of Jan van Eyck's religious
compositions.  The scene is in the circular
apse of a Romanesque church, lighted by the
soft rays that filter through the leaded
windows.  The Virgin, draped in a red cloak, is
seen in the centre under a green canopy, holding
the Christ-Child in her lap.  She has the same
heavy, matronly features as the Virgin of <i>The
Annunciation</i> in St. Petersburg and of the
Chancellor Rolin picture in Paris, and is no
more idealised than the by no means attractive
infant Saviour, who is playing with a parrot.
It is all very human and wonderfully true, and
for that very reason lacking in spiritual
significance.  On the left stands St. Donatian in a
gorgeous and marvellously painted brocade
robe, whilst on the right St. George, in
armour, presents the kneeling Canon van der
Paele to the Virgin.  The patron saint, again,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
is obviously painted from a model of low rank
in life&mdash;perhaps a peasant or a stableman;
whilst the rugged irregular features of the donor
are set down with an honest and painstaking
straightforwardness that seems to delight in doing
full justice to all the sitter's ugliness.  As
objective portraiture pure and simple, this head of van
der Paele has probably never been surpassed
in the whole history of art.  The supreme
mastery of Jan van Eyck manifests itself in the
creation of a work of unforgettable beauty and
sumptuous splendour from such unpromising
material.  The ugliness of the types chosen is
forgotten when one's eyes revel in the rich
scheme of colour, the extraordinary beauty of
the painting of all the stuffs and accessories,
the perfect modelling of the features, and,
above all, the (for the time) amazing knowledge
of the effect of light.  With all the richness of
pigment there is not a single note in this whole
large panel that is not absolutely "in tone";
nothing is forced, nothing arbitrary, as though
the fifteenth-century master had already adopted
the principle of the nineteenth-century
impressionists&mdash;"the first subject of a
picture is light."
</p>

<p>
The van der Paele altar-piece was in the
sacristy of the church of St. Donatian when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
the old basilica was destroyed by the revolutionary
troops.  It was taken to Paris, together
with much other artistic booty, but was returned
to Bruges in 1814, and is now in the Museum
of the Academy of that city.  The drapery round
the loins of the infant Saviour is a later
addition which does not appear in the excellent
early copy at the Antwerp Museum, from
which our illustration is a reproduction.  The
original at Bruges bears the inscription in small
Gothic letters: <i>Hoc opus fecit fieri magister
Georgius de Pala, huius ecclesie canonicus, per
Johannem de Eyck pictorem.  Et fundavit hic duas
capellanias de gremio chori domini M. ccc°.  xxxiiij°.,
completing anno</i> 1436°.
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
At the Museum of Antwerp is the exquisite
unfinished little painting of <i>St. Barbara</i>, signed
and dated: JOHES DE EYCK ME FECIT 1437.  The
saint, with an open book on her lap and a
palm-branch in her hand, is seated in front of an
elaborately designed Gothic tower in course of
construction.  Around the tower are numerous
figures of labourers, masons, horsemen, and
others; and the background shows a landscape
with mountains, castles, rivers, fields and trees,
and a town on a hill.  Technically, this picture
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
is supremely interesting, as it shows that at a
comparatively late period of his life&mdash;a quarter
of a century after the reputed discovery of
oil-painting&mdash;Jan has not altogether discarded the
practice of tempera-painting.  For the whole
composition, the pensive-looking saint and
the widespread angular folds of her garment, the
tower and the figures, are carefully drawn and
shaded in brown tempera colour on a preparation
of gum or white of egg.  Only the part
which required no special design, the sky, is
painted in oil-colour.  It may thus be assumed
that it was the practice of the brothers van
Eyck to work with oil-colours on a tempera
foundation.
</p>

<p>
The <i>St. Barbara</i> also confirms Karel van
Mander's statement that Jan's sketches were
more complete and more carefully wrought
than the finished paintings of other artists.
M. Henri Hymaus suggests that this
<i>St. Barbara</i> is the very painting which van
Mander mentions as being in the possession of
his master Lucas de Heere at Ghent, and
"representing a woman behind whom was a
landscape; it was but a preparation, and yet
extraordinarily beautiful."

Our last illustration represents, or is supposed
to represent, <i>The Enthronement of Thomas à
Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury</i>, and is in
the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, at
Chatsworth.  In a late Norman church Thomas
à Becket is seen in the foreground under a
scarlet canopy, with the Holy Ghost hovering
near, and above is a splendid crown in which
the figure of the risen Christ is introduced;
above the crown is a circle with a Virgin and
Child.  Three Bishops are engaged in placing
the mitre upon the head of the saint, while a
priest with an open book is kneeling before
him.  On the right are the clergy and on the
left the laity, with King Henry II. at their
head.  On the border is the inscription: <i>Johes
de Eyck, fecit, ano, M°.CCCCZI, 30° Octobris</i>.
This inscription, if genuine, is the only evidence
of Jan's authorship of the picture which has
been entirely repainted, so that nothing of the
original work is to be seen.  The date, 1421,
is eleven years earlier than any other dated
picture by Jan van Eyck.  It is scarcely
necessary to point out the importance of this
fact to the art historian in search of evidence
of Jan's early activity; but whilst the picture
remains in its present condition it cannot throw
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
any light upon the debated points.  Only if the
surface paint were removed would it be
possible to judge whether below it is a real
early work of Jan van Eyck, and what was
the relative position of the two brothers before
Hubert's death.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Enthronement of Thomas à Becket</i> has
an interesting pedigree.  It was given by
John, Duke of Bedford, to King Henry V., and
was afterwards in the collection of the second
Earl of Arundel, who died at Padua in 1646,
bequeathing it to Henry, the sixth Duke of
Norfolk, by whose son, the seventh Duke, it
was sold.  It came through the Duke's steward,
Mr. Fox, to a Mr. Sykes, who sold it to the
Duke of Devonshire in 1722.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
